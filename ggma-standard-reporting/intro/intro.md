# Introduction

## About this Workshop                             
The labs in this workshop are designed to test the standard reporting feature available with Oracle GoldenGate 23ai. In this tutorial, you will run automated scripts for configuring a sample data replication environment and use it to generate standard business reports.  

The scripts allow you to use two approaches for configuring Oracle GoldenGate data replication and generate standard business reports:

•	Using cURL
•	Using OBEY Commands from the Admin Client

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hour


### About Oracle GoldenGate Standard Reporting

Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture provides a RESTful interface to install, deploy, configure, monitor, and manage change data with near real-time data integration and replication.

You can use various alternatives to configure Oracle GoldenGate: 

*	The Admin Client CLI using OBEY commands

*	The REST API cURL commands


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
  
  * Run cURL commands using an automation script to set up unidirectional data replication.
  * Access the Standard Business Reports based on preloaded data.
  * Delete the data replication environment using cURL commands in another automation script.
  * Run the OBEY commands using an automation script to set up unidirectional data replication.
  * Access View the Standard Business Reports
  * Delete the data replication environment using OBEY commands in another automation script
  

### Prerequisites
The following are required to complete this lab:

* Prior knowledge of using cURL commands 
* Prior knowledge of Oracle GoldenGate Admin Client commands


You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
