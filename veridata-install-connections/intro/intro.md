# Introduction

## About this Workshop                             

The labs in this workshop walk you through several use cases with Oracle GoldenGate Veridata, including: Create datasoure connections, create groups, configure compare pairs, create and execute jobs, view reports, repair data, and generate SQL files.

*Estimated Lab Time*: 4 hours

### About Oracle GoldenGate Veridata
Oracle GoldenGate Veridata compares a source (original, or trusted) set of data with a target (secondary) set of data to identify discrepancies. By accounting for data that is being replicated while a comparison takes place, Oracle GoldenGate Veridata can run concurrently with data transactions and replication, while still producing an accurate comparison report. You can use Oracle GoldenGate Veridata to compare data sets that reside in identical or different types of databases; the workflow is essentially the same for all supported databases, with only very minor differences.
