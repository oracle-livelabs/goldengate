# Introduction

## About this Workshop                             
The labs in this workshop are designed to test the standard reporting feature available with Oracle GoldenGate 23ai. In this tutorial, you will run automated scripts for configuring a sample data replication environment and use it to generate standard business reports.  

The scripts allow you to use two approaches for configuring Oracle GoldenGate data replication and generate standard business reports:

*	Using REST API cURL scripts

*	Using Admin Client with OBEY Commands


Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hour


### About Oracle GoldenGate Topologies

There are many different topologies in real world scenarios and various combinations of topologies used as per organization requirements. Oracle GoldenGate manages to bring similarities between these configurations, making administration easier irrespective of the topology.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will use automation scripts to set up different topologies with cURL commands and OBEY scripts, for the following use cases:
  
  * Generate and view standard reports in a unidirectional replication environment.
  * Configure bidirectional replication and check for replicated transactions between different PDBs.
  * Configure a cascading replication topology across three PDBs.
  

### Prerequisites

The following are required to complete this lab:

* Prior knowledge of using cURL commands 
* Prior knowledge of Oracle GoldenGate Admin Client commands


You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
