# Introduction

## About this Workshop                             
The labs in this workshop are designed to test the standard reporting feature available with Oracle GoldenGate 23ai. In this tutorial, you will run automated scripts for configuring a sample data replication environment and use it to generate standard business reports.  

The scripts allow you to use two approaches for configuring Oracle GoldenGate data replication and generate standard business reports:

•	Using cURL
•	Using OBEY Commands from the Admin Client

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hour


### About Oracle GoldenGate Topologies

There are many different topologies in real world scenarios and various combinations of topologies used as per organization requirements. Oracle GoldenGate manages to bring similarities between these configurations, making administration easier irrespective of the topology.
