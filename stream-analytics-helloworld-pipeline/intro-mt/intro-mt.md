# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop walks you through steps to use a Stream Analytics pipeline for real-time traffic analysis, speed violation tracking, and congestion detection, to monitor public transport.

Key features of this traffic management solution:
* It uses GPS fleet data which is low cost, accurate, and created in real time. This data reduces congestion on roadways, enhancing the traveling experience, and is hence valuable for government sector customers.
* The general features represented in this solution are real-time traffic analytics, speed violation tracking, and congestion detection. These features are combined with GPS streaming sensor feeds and historical trend data using map-based visualizations.
* This solution uses enterprise-grade Spark Streaming, Kafka open-source messaging, a highly scalable, extensible platform built with Stream Analytics.

Some of the key benefits with this solution are low-cost rollout with zero-road, network disruption, real-time operational intelligence, which is essential for meaningful congestion reduction, and an enhanced traveler experience, with a leading streaming big data technology.

*Estimated Time*:  2 hours
