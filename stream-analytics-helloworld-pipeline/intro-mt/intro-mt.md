# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop walks you through steps to use a Stream Analytics pipeline for real-time traffic analysis, speed violation tracking, and congestion detection, to monitor public transport.

Key features of this traffic management solution:
* It uses GPS fleet data.
* This data is low cost, accurate, and it is created in real time.
* This fleet data reduces congestion on roadways, and enhances the traveling experience, and is hence valuable for government sector customers.
* The general features represented in this solution are real-time traffic analytics, speed violation tracking, and congestion detection. These features are combined with GPS streaming sensor feeds and historical trend data using map-based visualizations.
* This solution uses enterprise-grade Spark Streaming, Kafka open-source messaging, a highly scalable, extensible platform built with Stream Analytics.

Some of the key benefits with this solution are low-cost rollout with zero-road, network disruption, real-time operational intelligence, which is essential for meaningful congestion reduction, and an enhanced traveler experience, with a leading streaming big data technology.
