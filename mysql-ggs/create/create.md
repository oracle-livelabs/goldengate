# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources that you'll need to complete this workshop.

Estimated time: 30 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. You can create different deployments types such as, Oracle Database, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or Big Data. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections capture source and target credential information. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for MySQL Heatwave
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for Autonomous Data Warehouse
* Create connections for the source MySQL Heatwave and target Autonomous Data Warehouse
* Assign connections to deployments

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you completed the environment set up lab, if you're running this workshop on your own tenancy.

To successfully complete this lab in your own tenancy:
* For IAM-enabled tenancies, ensure that you [configure Identity domains for OCI GoldenGate](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/goldengate-service/mkmbs/#GUID-DD9C1BF8-69FE-4C9A-A2D1-74C73550ED65).
* For non-IAM enabled tenancies, ensure that you ensure that you first [set up your Vault](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Tasks/managingvaults_topic-To_create_a_new_vault.htm#createnewvault). [Learn more about Vault service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm).
