# Set up the environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create the resources required to complete this workshop. You'll learn to create a VCN and subnet, a bastion, provision OCI MySQL Database and autonomous database instances, and load data into the databases.

Estimated time: 30 mins

### Objectives

-  Provision a VCN and subnet
-  Create a bastion
-  Provision, connect, and load data into an OCI MySQL Database system
-  Provision, connect, load target schemas into an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the Get started lab.

> **Note:** *You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.*

In this section, you will provision a VCN and subnet, ATP and ADW instances, and load data to use with OCI GoldenGate.

## Task 1: Create a VCN and subnet

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Networking**, and select **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

	![Virtual Cloud Networks in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/networking-vcn.png " ")

2.  On the **Virtual Cloud Networks in &lt;compartment-name&gt;** page, click **Start VCN Wizard**.

You're returned to the DB Systems page where the MySQL DB System you created appears. It will take a few minutes for the system to become Active.

## Task 3A: Create a bastion and session

Create a bastion and session only if your OCI GoldenGate deployment and OCI MySQL Database system are **not** located in the same region. If they're in the same Home region, skip to Task 3B.

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console navigation menu, click **Identity & Security**, and then click **Bastion**.

	![Click Bastion under Identity & Security in the Oracle Cloud console navigation menu](./images/03-01-bastion.png " ")

	![Click Create bastion on Bastions page](./images/03-02-create-bastion.png " ")

3.  In the Create bastion panel, for **Name**, leave the default or replace the default with the name of your choice.

4.  Under **Configure networking**, select the VCN and subnet in which your MySQL DB system resides.

5.  For **CIDR block allowlist**, enter `0.0.0.0/0` and then select **0.0.0.0/0 (New)** in the dropdown menu to add it.

	![CIDR block allowlist](./images/03-05-cidr.png " ")

6.  Click **Create bastion**. The bastion appears in the Bastion list and takes a few minutes to become Active.

7.  After the bastion is Active, select it to view its details.

8.  On the bastion details page, click **Create session**.

	![Click Create session on the bastion details page](./images/03-08-create-session.png " ")

9.  In the Create session panel, for **Session type**, select **SSH port forwarding session**.

	![Select SSH port forwarding session for Session type](./images/03-09-session-type.png " ")

10. For IP address, paste the private IP address copied from the SourceMySQL database details page in Task 2 Step 11.

11. For port, enter `3306`.

12. Under Add SSH Key, you can upload an existing key or generate a new SSH key pair.

	>**Note:** *If you select **Generate SSH key pair**, ensure that you download and save the private key.*

13. Click **Create session**. The session takes a few minutes to become Active.

14. After the session is Active, select **Copy SSH command** from the session's Action (three dots) menu.

	![Click the three dots and then select Copy SSH command](./images/03-14-copy-ssh-cmd.png " ")

**Proceed to Task 4.**

## Task 3B: Using CloudShell to connect to the private network

If working within the same Home region for OCI GoldenGate and OCI MySQL Database, then you can use CloudShell to connect to the private network.

1.  After your OCI MySQL DB system becomes active, open CloudShell from the Oracle Cloud console global header.

	![Open CloudShell](./images/03b-01-open-cloudshell.png " ")

2.  After CloudShell opens and initializes, click **Network: Public**, and then select **Private Network Setup**.

	![CloudShell Network](./images/03b-02-cloudshell.png " ")

3.  Select the VCN and Subnet your OCI MySQL DB system uses, and then click **Connect to this network**.

4.  After CloudShell is connected to the private network, proceed to Task 4, Step 6 below.

## Task 4: Load data into the MySQL DB System

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console global header, click **Cloud Shell**. Cloud Shell opens in a panel at the bottom of the console.

	![Click Cloud Shell in the console global header](./images/04-01-cloudshell.png " ")

2.  Open the Cloud Shell menu (gear icon) and then select **Upload**.

	![Select Upload from Cloud Shell menu](./images/04-02-upload.png " ")

3.  In the Upload dialog window, upload the private key associated with the SSH key used to create the bastion in Task 3 Step 12.

	>**Note:** *You can Hide the upload window after the upload completes.*

4.  Paste the SSH command copied from the bastion session in Task 3 Step 14. Replace `<privateKey>` with the name if the private you uploaded to Cloud Shell and `<localPort>` with any valid port number.

5.  Run the command.

	>**Note:** *If you're warned that your private key is too open, run `chmod 600 <privateKey>` and then try again. After the host is added to the list of known hosts, you can add an ampersand (&) to the end of the command to have it run in the background.*

6.  Run `mysqlsh admin@localhost:3306 --sql` and then enter the MySQL database admin password from Task 2 Step 7.

7.  Download and run the sample data script.

	 [seedSRCOCIGGL_MySQL.sql](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/VEKec7t0mGwBkJX92Jn0nMptuXIlEpJ5XJA-A6C9PymRgY2LhKbjWqHeB5rVBbaV/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/seedSRCOCIGGL_MySQL.sql)

8.  Create the ggadmin user using the following script. Ensure that you replace `<ggadmin-password>` with a valid password.

		<copy>CREATE USER 'ggadmin' IDENTIFIED BY '<ggadmin-password>';
		GRANT SELECT, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE,CREATE VIEW, EVENT, INSERT, UPDATE, DROP,EXECUTE, DELETE ON *.* TO 'ggadmin';</copy>

9.  Close CloudShell.

## Task 5: Create an ADW instance

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

	![Autonomous Data Warehouse in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/database-adw.png " ")

2.  Click **Create Autonomous Database**.

  ![Autonomous Database page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/adb/images/01-02-create-adb.png " ")

3.  On the Create Autonomous Database page, select a **Compartment** from the dropdown.

 >**Note:** *If running this workshop in a LiveLab sandbox environment, select the compartment associated to your username.*

4.  Enter **TargetADW** for **Display Name** and **Database Name**.

5.  Under **Choose a workload type**, select **Data Warehouse**.

6.  Under **Choose a deployment type**, select **Shared Infrastructure**.

	![Example ADW instance creation](./images/05-05-create-adw.png " ")

7.  Under Create administrator credentials, enter a password and confirm the password. Note the password down in a notepad, you will need it later.

8.  Under **Choose a license type**, select **License Included**.

9.  Click **Create Autonomous Database**.

	The Autonomous Data Warehouse instance appears in the list of databases. It becomes active in a few minutes.

## Task 6: Unlock the GGADMIN user and load the sample schema

1.  After the instance becomes Active, select it to view its details and access tools.
