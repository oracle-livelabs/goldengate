# Set up the environment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create the resources required to complete this workshop. You'll learn to create a VCN and subnet, a bastion, provision MySQL Heatwave and autonomous database instances, and load data into the databases.

Estimated time: 30 mins

### Objectives

-  Provision a VCN and subnet
-  Create a bastion
-  Provision, connect, and load data into a MySQL Heatwave system
-  Provision, connect, load target schemas into an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed the Get started lab.

> **Note:** You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.

In this section, you will provision a VCN and subnet, ATP and ADW instances, and load data to use with OCI GoldenGate.

## Task 1: Create a VCN and subnet

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Networking**, and select **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

	![Virtual Cloud Networks in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/networking-vcn.png " ")

2.  On the **Virtual Cloud Networks in &lt;compartment-name&gt;** page, click **Start VCN Wizard**.

	![Copy the Private IP](./images/02-11-private-ip.png " ")


## Task 3A: Create a bastion and session

> **Note:** Create a bastion and session only if your OCI GoldenGate deployment and MySQL Heatwave system are **not** located in the same region. If they're in the same Home region, skip to Task 3B.

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console navigation menu, click **Identity & Security**, and then click **Bastion**.

	![Click Bastion under Identity & Security in the Oracle Cloud console navigation menu](./images/03-01-bastion.png " ")

11. For port, enter `3306`.

12. Under Add SSH Key, you can upload an existing key or generate a new SSH key pair.

	>**Note:** If you select **Generate SSH key pair**, ensure that you download and save the private key.

13. Click **Create session**. The session takes a few minutes to become Active.

	![Enter the details and click Create session](./images/03-09-session-type.png " ")

14. After the session is Active, select **Copy SSH command** from the session's Action (three dots) menu.

	![Click the three dots and then select Copy SSH command](./images/03-14-copy-ssh-cmd.png " ")


## Task 3B: Using CloudShell to connect to the private network

If working within the same Home region for OCI GoldenGate and MySQL Heatwave, then you can use CloudShell to connect to the private network.

1.  After your OCI MySQL DB system becomes active, click **Developer tools** in the Oracle Cloud console global header, and then select **Cloud Shell**.

	![Open CloudShell](./images/03b-01-open-cloudshell.png " ")

2.  After CloudShell opens and initializes, click **Network: Public**, and then select **Ephemeral Private Network Setup**.

	![CloudShell Network](./images/03b-02-cloudshell.png " ")

3.  Select the VCN and Subnet your OCI MySQL DB system uses, and then click **Use as active network**.

4.  After CloudShell is connected to the private network, enter the following command to connect to the MySQL database:

	> **Note:** Ensure that you replace `<mysql-db-privateIP>` with the private IP of your MySQL database.

		<copy>mysqlsh admin@<mysql-db-privateIP>:3306 --sql</copy>

5.  Proceed to Task 4, Step 7.

## Task 4: Load data into the MySQL DB System

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console global header, click **Developer tools**, and then select **Cloud Shell**. Cloud Shell opens in a panel at the bottom of the console.

	![Click Cloud Shell in the console global header](./images/03b-01-open-cloudshell.png " ")

2.  Open the Cloud Shell menu (gear icon) and then select **Upload**.

	![Select Upload from Cloud Shell menu](./images/04-02-upload.png " ")

3.  In the Upload dialog window, upload the private key associated with the SSH key used to create the bastion in Task 3 Step 12.

	>**Note:** You can Hide the upload window after the upload completes.

4.  Paste the SSH command copied from the bastion session in Task 3 Step 14. Replace `<privateKey>` with the name if the private you uploaded to Cloud Shell and `<localPort>` with any valid port number.

5.  Run the command.

	>**Note:** If you're warned that your private key is too open, run `chmod 600 <privateKey>` and then try again. After the host is added to the list of known hosts, you can add an ampersand (&) to the end of the command to have it run in the background.

6.  Run the following command and then enter the MySQL database admin password from Task 2 Step 7.

		<copy>mysqlsh admin@localhost:3306 --sql</copy>

7.  Download and run the sample data script.

	 [seedSRCOCIGGL_MySQL.sql](https://objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/p/VEKec7t0mGwBkJX92Jn0nMptuXIlEpJ5XJA-A6C9PymRgY2LhKbjWqHeB5rVBbaV/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/seedSRCOCIGGL_MySQL.sql)

8.  Create the ggadmin user using the following script. Ensure that you replace `<ggadmin-password>` with a valid password.

		<copy>CREATE USER 'ggadmin' IDENTIFIED BY '<ggadmin-password>';
		GRANT SELECT, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, CREATE,CREATE VIEW, EVENT, INSERT, UPDATE, DROP,EXECUTE, DELETE ON *.* TO 'ggadmin';</copy>
