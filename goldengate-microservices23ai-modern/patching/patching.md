# Patch Oracle GoldenGate

## Introduction

Installing patches is critical to the continued functionality and support of Oracle GoldenGate and the Oracle GoldenGate product team highly recommends that you review and apply the most recent cumulative patch.  New patches are generally released every three to four months and are available at [support.oracle.com](https://support.oracle.com). Additionally, the product team updates the [Oracle Data Integration](https://blogs.oracle.com/dataintegration/post/how-to-obtain-the-latest-oracle-goldengate-microservices-architecture-bundle-patches) blog whenever a new patch is available for the different supported versions of Oracle GoldenGate. 

Patching Oracle GoldenGate has never been easier when using the Microservices Architecture. An out-of-place patching protocol can be followed that allows GoldenGate administrators to install a complete patched version side by side with the previous installation, and then easily switch the GoldenGate Deployment(s) and Service Manager to the new GoldenGate Home.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you learn to patch Oracle GoldenGate 23.7 to Oracle GoldenGate 23.8.

## Task 1: Install Oracle GoldenGate 23.8

For this lab, a complete patched version of Oracle GoldenGate 23.8 has been installed in a separate GoldenGate Home. However, if you were setting this up in your own environment, you would download and install the patched version from [support.oracle.com](https://support.oracle.com). Look for a package that matches your database and operating system, and includes **Complete Install** in the Description field. For example, the highlighted package below is the complete patch installation of Oracle GoldenGate 23.8 for Linux, for the Oracle Database:

## Task 2: Stop the GoldenGate processes

1. In order to patch the current GoldenGate 23.7 environment, it's necessary to stop all running GoldenGate processes. In the GoldenGate console navigation menu, click **Extracts**.

2. On the Extracts page, click **Stop** for the EWEST Extract. To patch the current GoldenGate 23.7 environment, you must first stop running all GoldenGate processes.

4. On the Replicats page, click **Stop** for the REAST Replicat.

## Task 3: Switch Deployments to the new GoldenGate 23.8 version

1. Open a browser tab to the Service Manager at [http://localhost:9011](http://localhost:9011), if it's not already open, and log in as **oggadmin**. You can copy the password from the password_file.txt.
