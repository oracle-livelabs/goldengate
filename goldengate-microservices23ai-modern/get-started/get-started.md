# Get Started - Hands-On Lab
## Introduction

Welcome to the **GoldenGate 23ai Microservices for Modern Real-Time Data Fabric Solutions** Hands-on Lab! To begin the workshop, you’ll need to connect to a virtual system that has been assigned specifically to you. This connection will be established through your web browser using a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) session to access your remote lab environment.

We’ll guide you step-by-step on where to find your connection details and how to connect to your system.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes
