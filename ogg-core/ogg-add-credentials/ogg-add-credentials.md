# Add database credentials

## About Workshop
This lab describes how to add the database credentials to connect to the source and target databases from the Administration Service.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Connect to the Administration Service from the Admin Client.
* Create Database credentials for Oracle Multitenant Container Databases.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes that you have:
- The appropriate database privileges to be able to execute the commands in the Admin Client.

## Task 1: Connect to the Administration Service from the Admin Client

1. Run the script: `adminclient` to open the Admin Client.

    **Note**: You donâ€™t need to navigate to the *OGG_HOME/bin*  directory to run the Admin Client each time. The PATH environment variable is set for this. This is a client-server connection.

2. Execute the following command to connect to the Administration Service:

    ```
    <copy>
    CONNECT http://phoenix98251.dev3sub1phx.databasede3phx.oraclevcn.com:9010 DEPLOYMENT NORTH as oggadmin PASSWORD oggadmin
    </copy>
    ```


## Task 2: Add Database Credentials

You need to establish 2 database connections (`pdbeast` and `pdbwest`) through the Admin Client in preparation to issue other Oracle GoldenGate commands that affect the database.

To create database credentials in the Administration Client:

1. Run the following command to add a user `ggeast`:

    ```
    <copy>
    ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE ADD USER ggadmin@orclpdbeast ALIAS ggeast  DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate PASSWORD Welcome1
    </copy>
    ```

2.  To test the database connection, run the following command:
    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggeast
    </copy>
    ```

3. Run the following command to add a user `ggwest`:

    ```
    <copy>
    ALTER CREDENTIALSTORE ADD USER ggadmin@orclpdbwest ALIAS ggwest  DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate PASSWORD Welcome1
    </copy>
    ```
4.  To test the database connection, run the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggwest
    </copy>
    ```
    You have now successfully created database credentials for the source (`ggeast`) and target (`ggwest`) databases.

  After connecting to the databases, you can enable TRANDATA, add Heartbeat and Checkpoint tables.

  You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
