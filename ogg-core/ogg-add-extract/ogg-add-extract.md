# Add Extract

## Introduction
Use `ADD EXTRACT` to create an Extract group/process.

This lab describes how to add an Extract group (`exte`), which then captures data from the source database and writes to a trail file (`ea`).

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Create an Extract process.
* Edit the parameter file.
* Register the Extract process.
* Add the Extract trail.
* Start the Extract process.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes that you have:
- The appropriate database privileges to be able to execute the commands in the Admin Client.
- Completed the tasks in **Lab - Enable Trandata, Add Heartbeat and Checkpoint Tables**.

## Task 1: Add an Extract Process

To add an extract process and Exttrail:

1. Test the database connection by running the following command:
    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggeast
    </copy>
    ```

2. Add an Extract:
    ```
    <copy>
    ADD EXTRACT exte, TRANLOG, BEGIN NOW
    </copy>
    ```

    **exte** is the name of the Extract that is being created. However, the Extract is yet to start.
3. Configure the Extract parameters in the Extract parameter file (`exte.prm`):
    ```
    <copy>
    EDIT PARAMS exte
    </copy>
    ```
    The Extract parameter file is as follows:
    ```
    <copy>
    EXTRACT exte
    USERIDALIAS cggnorth DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate
    EXTTRAIL east/ea
    SOURCECATALOG pdbeast
    DDL INCLUDE MAPPED
    TABLE hr.*;
    </copy>
    ```

4. Register the Extract:
    ```
    <copy>
    REGISTER EXTRACT exte
    </copy>
    ```

5.  Add the Extract trail file:
    ```
    <copy>
    ADD EXTTRAIL east/ea
    </copy>
    ```

6. Start the Extract:
    ```
    <copy>
    START EXTRACT exte
    </copy>
    ```
  The Extract group **exte** starts.

7. To confirm the Extract has started, run the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    INFO EXTRACT exte
    </copy>
    ```

The following is a sample Extract output:

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
