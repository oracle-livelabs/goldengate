# Add Replicat

## Introduction
Use ADD REPLICAT to create a Replicat process.

This lab describes how to add a Replicat process (`repe`), which then delivers the change data from the trail file (`ea`) created by the Extract, to the target database.
Replicat reads the trail file on the target database, reconstructs the DML or DDL operations, and applies them to the target database.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
* Create a Replicat process.
* Edit the parameter file.
* Start the Replicat process.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes that you have:
- The appropriate database privileges to be able to execute the commands in the Admin Client.
- Completed the tasks in **Lab - Enable Trandata, Add Heartbeat and Checkpoint Tables**.
- Completed the tasks in **Lab - Add Extract**.

## Task 1: Add a Replicat

To add a Replicat:

1. Test the database connection by running the following command:
    ```
    <copy>
    DBLOGIN USERIDALIAS ggwest
    </copy>
    ```

2. Add a Replicat:
    ```
    <copy>
    ADD REPLICAT repe, INTEGRATED, PARALLEL, EXTTRAIL east/ea CHECKPOINTTABLE ggadmin.ggs_checkpointtable
    </copy>
    ```
    `repe` is the name of the Replicat that is being created.

3. Edit the parameter file:
    ```
    <copy>
    EDIT PARAMS repe
    </copy>
    ```
    The Replicat parameter file is as follows:
    ```
    <copy>
    REPLICAT repe
    USERIDALIAS ggwest DOMAIN OracleGoldenGate
    DDL INCLUDE ALL
    SOURCECATALOG pdbeast
    MAP hr.*, TARGET hr.*;
    </copy>
    ```

4. Start the REPLICAT:
    ```
    <copy>
    START REPLICAT repe
    </copy>
    ```
  The REPLICAT process **repe** starts.

5. To confirm the REPLICAT has started, run the following command:
    ```
    <copy>
    INFO REPLICAT repe
    </copy>
    ```
The following is a sample Replicat output:

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
