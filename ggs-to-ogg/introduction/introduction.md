# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle GoldenGate, the industry-leading data replication and integration software, is now available as a fully-managed, cloud native service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). If you're an existing Oracle GoldenGate customer with an on-premises installation or Marketplace image, then use this LIveLab to help you pull data down from OCI GoldenGate to Oracle GoldenGate.

For the purposes of this workshop, Autonomous Transaction Processing serves as the source database and Autonomous Data Warehouse serves as the target database.

Estimated Time: 120 minutes
