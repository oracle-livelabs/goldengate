# Send the OCI GoldenGate Trail File to Oracle GoldenGate

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to capture and send data from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate to an on premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance. You'll create an Extract to capture data from the source database, a Receiver Path to initiate pulling the data down to the target, and a Replicat to consume the data received.

Estimated time: 25 minutes

### About Extracts, Paths, and Replicats
An Extract is a process that extracts, or captures, data from a source database. A Receiver Path is a target-initiated configuration that uses the Receiver Server. A Replicat is a process that delivers data to the target.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Add and run an Extract process to capture data
* Add and run a Receiver Path to pull the trail file down to Oracle GoldenGate
* Add and run a Replicat process to consume the trail file received from OCI GoldenGate

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs. For the purposes of this lab, the source database used in this lab is Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing and the target database is Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse.

## Task 1: Add Transaction Data

1.  In the OCI GoldenGate Deployment console, select **Overview** from the navigation menu (hamburger icon), and then click **DB Connections**.
