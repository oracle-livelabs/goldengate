# Connect Oracle GoldenGate to Autonomous Data Warehouse

## Introduction

For the purposes of this workshop, Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) serves as the target database for your Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace deployment. This lab walks you through the steps to connect your Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace deployment to Autonomous Data Warehouse.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Download the Autonomous Data Warehouse credentials
* Upload the Autonomous Data Warehouse credentials to the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace compute instance
* Add the Autonomous Data Warehouse credentials in the Oracle GoldenGate Administration Server

### Prerequisites

* Follow the instructions for [Connecting to a Linux Instance ](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/accessinginstance.htm#linux) to enter your private key for the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace Compute instance.
* Open a text editor to paste values you need for later tasks.

## Task 1: Download the Target Autonomous Data Warehouse Client Credentials

1.  In the OCI Console breadcrumb, click **Autonomous Database**, and then select **TargetADW** from the list of databases.

    </if>

    ![Download Wallet page](./images/01-04-download-wallet.png " ")

5.  Save the wallet zip to your local machine.

6.  Close the Database connection panel.

    ![Close Download Wallet page](./images/01-05-close-db-connection.png " ")

## Task 2: Upload the Target Autonomous Data Warehouse Credentials to Oracle GoldenGate

1.  In the Oracle Cloud Console, open the navigation menu (hamburger icon), click **Compute**, and then click **Instances**.

    ![Instances in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](./images/02-01-compute.png " ")

2.  Under **List Scope**, ensure that the correct **Compartment** is selected for your workshop. You can find your compartment information in the Workshop Details of this LiveLab.

3.  In the Oracle Cloud Console global header, click **Developer tools**, and then **Cloud Shell**. The Cloud Shell drawer opens at the bottom of your screen.

    >**NOTE**: Cloud Shell takes a few moments to connect the first time it's opened during a session. When prompted, enter N to exit the Cloud Shell tutorial.

    ![Instances page](./images/02-03-cloudshell.png " ")

4.  From the Cloud Shell drawer menu (gear icon) select **Upload**.

    ![Cloud Shell drawer menu](./images/02-04-cs-upload.png " ")

5.  In the File Upload to your Home Directory dialog, drag and drop or select the TargetADW wallet file you downloaded in Task 1, and then click **Upload**.

    ![Upload a file on Cloud Shell](./images/02-05-upload.png " ")

6.  Repeat step 5 to upload your SSH private key. Click **Hide** to close the File Transfers dialog.

    ![Files uploaded on Cloud Shell](./images/02-06-hide.png " ")

    <if type="livelabs">
    >**Note:** Ensure the private key you upload here is the match of the public key you provided when you reserved this lab.
    </if>

7.  To ensure the SSH key permissions are valid, enter the following command in Cloud Shell: (Remember to replace the `<private-SSH-key>` placeholder with the name of your private key.)

    ```
    <copy>chmod 600 <private-SSH-key></copy>
    ```

8.  On the Instances in <compartment-name> page, copy the compute instance's **Public IP Address**.

    ![Public IP Address on the Instance Details](./images/02-08-public-ip.png " ")

9.  In Cloud Shell, enter the following to connect to the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate compute instance: (Remember to replace the placeholders with their actual values.)

    ```
    <copy>sftp -i <private-SSH-key> opc@<ip-address></copy>
    ```

    <if type="livelabs">
    >**Note:** If you get a *Permission Denied* error, double check that the private SSH key matches the public SSH key.
    </if>

10. Enter the following `put` command to upload wallet\_ADW.zip to `/home/opc`.

    ```
    <copy>put Wallet_ADW.zip</copy>
    ```

11. Enter `exit` to close the sftp connection.

    ![Cloud Shell script](./images/02-11-cloud-shell.png " ")

12. SSH to the compute instance.

    ```
    <copy>ssh -i <private-SSH-key> opc@<ip-address></copy>
    ```

13. Enter `ls` to list the contents in the current directory. You should see two files, `ogg-credentials.json` and your wallet file.

14. Make a new directory called **wallet\_ADW**, and then extract the contents of the wallet\_ADW.zip to a new directory.

    ```
    <copy>mkdir wallet_ADW
unzip Wallet_ADW.zip -d wallet_ADW</copy>
    ```

15. Change directories to wallet_ADW.

    ```
    <copy>cd wallet_ADW</copy>
    ```

16. Enter `pwd`, and then copy the full path to the wallet files to be used in a later Task.

    ![Cloud Shell script](./images/02-16-cloud-shell.png " ")

17. Change directories back to the Home directory.

    ```
    <copy>cd ..</copy>
    ```

> **Note:** Leave Cloud Shell open.

## Task 3: Get the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate oggadmin Credentials

1.  If you previously closed the Cloud Shell connection, open Cloud Shell once more and SSH to the compute instance.

    ```
    <copy>ssh -i <private-SSH-key> opc@<ip-address></copy>
    ```

2. Enter `ls` to list the contents of the current directory.

3. Open `ogg-credentials.json` and copy the output to a text editor.

    ```
    <copy>cat ogg-credentials.json</copy>
    ```
    ![Cloud Shell script](./images/03-03-cloud-shell.png " ")

4.  Exit Cloud Shell.

    ![Exit Cloud Shell](./images/03-04-exit-cloud-shell.png " ")

## Task 4: Add the Target Autonomous Data Warehouse Credential in the Oracle GoldenGate Administration Server

1.  Launch the OCI GoldenGate deployment console.

2.  Open the OCI GoldenGate deployment console navigation menu (hamburger icon) and then click **Configuration**.

    ![Click Configuration in the OCI GoldenGate deployment console navigation menu](./images/04-02-configuration.png " ")

3.  Copy the TargetADW connection string in the User ID column, and then paste it into a text editor.

    ![Copy the target database's connection string and paste it into a text editor](./images/04-03-configuration-targetadw.png " ")

4.  Edit the TargetADW connection string, replacing the value for **MY\_WALLET\_DIRECTORY** with the location where you unzipped the wallet_ADW.zip. For example, **/home/opc/wallet\_ADW**.

    ![Replace the existing value for MY_WALLET_DIRECTORY with the path to the wallet files](./images/04-04-wallet-zip.png " ")

5.  In a new browser tab or window, use the compute instance's Public IP and port 443 (**https://&lt;public-ip&gt;:443**) to open the Service Manager.

6.  Log in to the Service Manager using the **oggadmin** credentials found in **/home/opc/ogg-credentials.json**.

7.  In the Service Manager, under **Services**, click the port number (9011) associated with the Administration Server. The Administration Server opens in a new browser tab. If you're prompted to log in again, use the same oggadmin credentials.

    ![Services pages on the Service Manager](./images/04-07-services.png " ")

8.  In the Administration Server, open the navigation menu (hamburger icon), and then select **Configuration**.

    ![Click Configuration in the Administration Server's navigation menu](./images/04-08-configuration.png " ")

9.  Click **Add Credential**.

    ![Click Add Credential on the Credentials page](./images/04-09-add-credential.png " ")

10. Enter the following information, and then click **Submit**:

    * For **Credential Domain**, enter **OracleGoldenGate**.
    * For **Credential Alias**, enter **TargetADW**.
    * For **User ID**, paste the Autonomous Data Warehouse connection string from step 4.
    * For **Password**, enter the ggadmin password provided when you created the TargetADW connection.

    ![Add a credential for atp_low](./images/04-10-submit-credential.png " ")

11. To test the connection, click **Connect to database** under Actions. Your connection credentials are correct if you see Checkpoint and TRANDATA options appear. If incorrect, you should check the connection string and ggadmin password.

In this lab, you created a connection from the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace instance to the target Autonomous Data Warehouse database. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
