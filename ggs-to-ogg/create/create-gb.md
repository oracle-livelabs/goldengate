# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Resources

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate Deployment and register connections.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Resources

A OCI GoldenGate **deployment** manages the resources it requires to function. The deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can create and manage GoldenGate processes such as Extracts, Replicats, and paths.

A **connection** captures source or target database credential information and syncs the information to OCI GoldenGate.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment
* Create the source and target connections
* Enable the GGADMIN user and supplemental logging
* Review the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Create a deployment

> **Note:** *Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.*

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **GoldenGate**.

    ![GoldenGate in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/database-goldengate.png " ")

You're brought to the Deployment Details page. It takes a few minutes for the deployment to be created. Its status will change from CREATING to ACTIVE when it is ready for  you to use.

## Task 2: Create the source connection

First, follow the steps below to connect the source Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing \(ATP\) Database.

1.  Use the Oracle Cloud Console breadcrumb to navigate back to the Deployments page.

    ![GoldenGate highlighted in Oracle Cloud Console breadcrumb](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/02-01-deployment-details.png " ")

2.  Click **Connections**.

    ![Connections in GoldenGate menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/02-02-connections.png " ")

3.  Click **Create connection**.

    ![Connections page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/02-03-create-connection.png " ")

4.  The Create connection panel consists of two pages. On the General information page, for Name, enter **SourceATP** and optionally, a description.

    ![Source Database details](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/02-10-create-connection-gg-details.png)

    The database registration becomes Active after a few minutes.

## Task 3: Unlock the GGADMIN user and enable supplemental logging for the source database

Oracle Autonomous Databases come with a GGADMIN user that is locked by default. The following steps guide you through how to unlock the GGADMIN user.

1.  From the Oracle Cloud Console **Navigation Menu** (hamburger icon), click **Oracle Database**, and then select **Autonomous Transaction Processing**.

	![Autonomous Transaction Processing in the Oracle Cloud Console navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/03-01-auto-db.png " ")

2.  From the list of databases, select **SourceATP**.

    ![Autonomous Transaction Processing page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/03-02-sourceatp.png " ")

3.  On the SourceATP Database Details page, click **Database Actions**.

    ![SourceATP Database Details page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/03-03-db-actions.png " ")

    > **Note:** *If you're prompted to log in to Database Actions, use the SourceATP admin credentials located in the Workshop Details.*

4.  Under **Administration**, click **Database Users**.

    ![Database Actions](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/03-04-db-users.png " ")

    <copy>
    select * from DBA_GOLDENGATE_SUPPORT_MODE where owner = 'SRC_OCIGGLL';
    </copy>
    ```

    The Script Output panel displays six tables whose Support_Mode is **FULL**.

    ![Script Output](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/03-09-sql-script-return.png " ")

    You can leave the SQL window open and continue with the next Task.

## Task 4: Create the target connection and unlock the GGADMIN user

Now, follow the steps below to connect the target Autonomous Data Warehouse \(ADW\) instance.

1.  Use the Oracle Cloud Console navigation menu to navigate back to GoldenGate.

2.  Click **Connections** and then **Create Connection**.

    ![Create Connection in GoldenGate menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/04-02-connections.png)

    The source and target databases appear in the list of Connections. The database registration becomes Active after a few minutes.

10.  Repeat Task 3, steps 1-8, to unlock the GGADMIN user and enable supplemental logging on the TargetADW database.

11.  Replace the supplemental logging script with the following to check support mode, and then click **Run Statement**:

    ```
    <copy>
    select * from DBA_GOLDENGATE_SUPPORT_MODE where owner = 'SRCMIRROR_OCIGGLL';
    </copy>
    ```

    The Script Output panel displays six tables whose Support_Mode is **FULL**.
