# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources that you'll need to complete this workshop.

Estimated time: 30 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. You can create different deployments types such as, Oracle Database, MySQL, or Big Data. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections capture source and target credential information. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for the Autonomous Database
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for Oracle Object Storage
* Create connections for the source Autonomous Databases and target Oracle Object Storage bucket
* Assign connections to deployments

### Prerequisites

In Task 5, you must upload a private key and enter the corresponding public key fingerprint. To add an API key:

1.  Oracle Cloud console global navigation bar, click **Profile** (user icon).

2.  On the user details page, under **Resources**, click API **Keys**.

3.  Click **Add API Key**.

4.  In the Add API Key dialog, click **Download Private Key**, and then click **Add**.

5.  In the Configuration File Preview dialog, copy the fingerprint to a text editor, and then click **Close**.

> **Note:** *Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.*

## Task 1: Create a deployment

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **GoldenGate**.
