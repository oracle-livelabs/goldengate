# Set up and run replication processes

## Introduction
This lab instructs you to use the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to add transaction information to the source database, and then add and run an Extract.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

### About Extracts, Distribution paths, and Replicats
An Extract is a process that extracts, or captures, data from a source database. A Distribution Path is a source-to-destination configuration that uses the Distribution Server.

### Objectives
In this lab, you learn to:

* Log in to the OCI GoldenGate deployment console
* Connect to the source database to add transaction information
* Add and run an Extract
* Add and run a Distribution path
* Add and run a Replicat


## Task 1: Review the Deployment details

1. In the Oracle Cloud console, open the navigation menu, click **Oracle Database**, and then click **GoldenGate**.

2. Click **Deployments**.

3. On the Deployments page, select **ATPDeployment** to view its details.

On the Deployment Details page, you can:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 2: Launch the GoldenGate Deployment Console

1. On the **ATPDeployment** details page, click **Launch Console**.

    ![ATPDeployment Launch Console](images/02-01-launch-console.png " ")

2. To log in to the GoldenGate deployment console, enter **oggadmin** for User name and the password, and then click **Sign In**.

In this lab, you:
* Added transaction data to the source database
* Added an Extract
* Created a user for the source deployment to connect to the target deployments
* Added a Distribution Path on the source deployment, which created a Receiver Path on the target deployment
* Added a Replicat process to replicate data from the Autonomous Transaction Processing instance to an OCI Object Storage bucket

**Proceed to the next lab**.
