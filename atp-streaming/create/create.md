# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources that you'll need to complete this workshop.

Estimated time: 30 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. You can create different deployments types such as, Oracle Database, MySQL, or Big Data. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections capture source and target credential information. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for the Autonomous Database
* Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for Oracle Object Storage
* Create connections for the source Autonomous Databases and target stream.
* Assign connections to deployments

### Prerequisites

To complete this lab:
* Ensure that you successfully completed the preceding lab.
* Your Autonomous Database is in the Active state.
* Create and download an Auth Token (see Task 0 for instructions).

> **Note:** *Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.*

## Task 0: Obtain the Stream Pool username and create an Auth Token

1.  Open the Oracle Cloud console navigation menu, click **Analytics & AI**, and under **Messaging**, click **Streaming**.
