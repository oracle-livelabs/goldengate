# Introduction

## About Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data
Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data offers a high-performance, fault-tolerant, easy-to-use, and flexible real-time data streaming platform for big data environments. Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture (MA) would configure and manage your data replication using an HTML user interface. The Oracle GoldenGate MA comprises the following components: Service Manager, Administration Server, Distribution Server, Receiver Server, Performance Metrics Server, and Admin Client.

In this hands-on lab, we will load data in the Oracle Database schema ***SOE*** of Pluggable Database ***PDB***. GG extract process ***EXTORA*** will capture the changes from Oracle Database and write them to the local trail file ***et***. The Distribution Service ***SRC2TGT*** will route the trail file  ***et*** to target GoldenGate(MA) for Big Data Receiver Service as ***rt***. The replicat process will read the remote trail files ***rt*** and replicates to the desired target ***(Apache Kafka, Apache Hadoop, Apache HBase, Cassandra, and MongoDB)***.

Estimated Workshop Time: 4 hours
