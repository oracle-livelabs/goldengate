# Introduction

## About Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data
Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data  offers high-performance, fault-tolerant, easy-to-use, and flexible real- time data streaming platform for big data environments.  Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture (MA) would    be configure and manage your data replication using an HTML user interface. The Oracle GoldenGate MA comprises the following components: Service Manager, Administration Server, Distribution Server, Receiver Server, Performance Metrics Server, and Admin Client. This workshop focuses on **GoldenGate Real Time Data Replication** demonstrating five scenarios that you can use (both on-premise and in the cloud) to capture real time data changes from your sources.

This hands-on lab is designed to demonstrate how  **Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture** and  **Oracle GoldenGate (MA) for Big Data** can be used to setup a replication environment by a mix of web page, shell scripts and Rest API interfaces. All labs will use shell scripts to facilitate the building of the environment, at the same time provide insight into how to use the web pages and AdminClient.The labs will walk the end-user through how to add all components of Oracle GoldenGate replication.
