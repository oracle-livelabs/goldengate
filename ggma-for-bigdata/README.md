## Oracle Goldengate for Big Data Microservices Workshop

Welcome to the Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data. The content will give you a basic understanding of **GoldenGate Microservices** and **Big Data**.

## Introduction

The Oracle GoldenGate Microservices for Big Data Workshop is designed to introduce replication capabilities from relational sources to **“Big Data”** targets, specifically ***HDFS, HBase, Kafka,MongoDB and Cassandra***. This workshop is based on Oracle GoldenGate Microservices Architecture and  Oracle GoldenGate (MA) for Big Data  which covers all GG supported Big Data targets, except Flume. Additional targets may be supported using open-source pluggable adapters. For more information, please discuss this with the workshop facilitator or the Data Integration Sales team.
