## What is OCI GoldenGate Stream Analytics

GoldenGate Stream Analytics (GGSA) is an environment that began as a Complex Event Processing engine and then evolved to run on top of runtime frameworks with Apache Spark and Apache Kafka. GGSA can ingest a stream of data from any source such as a database, GoldenGate, Kafka, JMS, REST, or even a file system file. After the data is in GGSA you can run analytics on live data.

A pipeline is a sequence of data processing stages such as, Query, Pattern, Rule, Query Group, Custom, and Scoring. You can apply business logic to an input data stream, within a pipeline.
