# Introduction to GoldenGate Stream Analytics

This workshop includes quick hands-on labs to transform and analyze real-time data streams, using Oracle GoldenGate Stream Analytics.

## What is GoldenGate Stream Analytics

Golden Gate Stream Analytics is an environment that originally began as a Complex Event Processing engine and evolved to run on top of runtime frameworks with Apache Spark and Apache Kafka.  The tool is designed to ingest a stream of data from any source such as a database, GoldenGate, Kafka, JMS, REST, or even a file system file. After the data is in GGSA you can run analytics on live data.

A pipeline includes a sequence of data processing stages such as, Query, Pattern, Rule, Query Group, Custom, and Scoring. You can apply business logic to an input data stream, within a pipeline.
