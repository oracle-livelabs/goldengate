### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Stream Analytics deployments and connections

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate Stream Analytics console, where you can create and manage Stream Analytics pipelines and dashboards.

Connections store the source and target credential information for OCI GoldenGate. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Create an OCI GoldenGate Stream Analytics deployment
* Create connections to OCI Streaming and GoldenGate replication
* Assign connections to the Stream Analytics deployment

### Prerequisites

To successfully complete this lab, you must:

* Have successfully completed the Get started lab
* If you enable public deployment console access when creating the deployment, OCI GoldenGate creates a load balancer in your tenancy VCN on your behalf. To ensure successful creation of the deployment and load balancer, you must have the appropriate policies, quotas, and limits in place.
* You may want a text editor open to keep track of values you need to reuse.

## Task 1: Create an OCI GoldenGate deployment for data replication

[](include:05-create-deployment.md)

## Task 2: Create a Stream Analytics deployment

> **Note:** Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

3.  You may need to select a compartment. Under List Scope, from the Compartment dropdown, expand the root compartment, and then select the compartment associated with your username. For example, if your LiveLab username is LL1234-user, expand root, expand LiveLabs, and then select the compartment **LL1234-COMPARTMENT**.

    > **Tip:** You can find your Username in the **Reservation Information** panel.

4.  On the Deployments page, a precreated **Replication** deployment appears in Deployments list for this lab. Click **Create deployment**.

    ![Deployments page](./images/01-04-create-deployment.png " ")

5.  In the Create Deployment panel, enter **GGSA** for Name.

6.  From the Compartment dropdown, select **&lt;USER&gt;-COMPARTMENT**.

7.  Select **Development or testing**. Your **OCPU count** updates to the preset governed by your selection.

8.  Select **Auto scaling**.

9.  For Subnet, select a private subnet. If you're using the workshop environment, select **&lt;USER&gt;-SUBNET-PRIVATE**.

10.  For License type, select **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.

11. Click **Show advanced options**, select **Enable GoldenGate console public access**, and then select a public subnet. 

12. Click **Next**.

    ![Completed Create GoldenGate Deployment fields](./images/create_deployment_1.png "" ) 

13. On the GoldenGate details screen, for Choose a deployment type, select **Stream analytics**.

14. For GoldenGate Instance Name, enter **ggsa**.

15. For Administrator Username, enter **osaadmin**.

16. For Password secret in &lt;USER&gt;-COMPARTMENT, click **Create password secret**.

    ![GoldenGate details](./images/create_deployment_2.png " ")

17. In the Create secret panel, enter `LLsecret`.

18. For User password, enter a password 8 to 30 alphanumeric characters in length, containing at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numeric, and 1 special character.

    > **NOTE**: The special characters must not be $, ^, or ?. 

    ![Create Password secret](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/create/images/01-21-passwordsecret.png " ")

19. Confirm the password, and then click **Create**.

20. Back in the Create deployment panel, for Password secret, ensure **LLsecret** is selected, and then click **Create**.

You're brought to the Deployment details page. Continue with the following tasks while the deployment creates. Its status changes from CREATING to ACTIVE when it's ready for you to use.

## Task 3: Create the source Autonomous Database connection

[](include:01-create-source-connection.md)


## Task 4: Create the GoldenGate connection

To create the GoldenGate connection, you must first obtain the data replication deployment host information and secret password contents.
