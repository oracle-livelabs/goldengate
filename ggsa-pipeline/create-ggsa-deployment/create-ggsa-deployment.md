### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Stream Analytics deployments and connections

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate Stream Analytics console, where you can create and manage Stream Analytics pipelines and dashboards.

Connections store the source and target credential information for OCI GoldenGate. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create an OCI GoldenGate Stream Analytics deployment
* Create connections to Kafka and GoldenGate replication
* Assign connections to the Stream Analytics deployment

### Prerequisites
* Completion of Get started - LiveLabs login

## Task 1: Log in to the Oracle Cloud console

1. In your lab instructions, click **View Login Info**. The Reservation Information panel opens.

3. The User Name should be auto filled. If not, copy and paste it from the Reservation Information panel.

4. For Password, copy and paste the **Password** from the Reservation Information panel. 

5. Click **Sign In**. 

    > **Note:** If this is your first time logging in, you must reset the default password.

## Task 2: Create a Stream Analytics deployment

> **Note:** Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

3.  You may need to select a compartment. Under List Scope, from the Compartment dropdown, expand the root compartment, and then select the compartment associated with your username. For example, if your LiveLab username is LL1234-user, expand root, expand LiveLabs, and then select the compartment **LL1234-COMPARTMENT**.

    > **Tip:** You can find your Username in the **Reservation Information** panel.

4.  On the Deployments page, a precreated **Replication** deployment appears in Deployments list for this lab. Click **Create deployment**.

    ![Deployments page](./images/01-04-create-deployment.png " ")

5.  In the Create Deployment panel, enter **GGSA** for Name.

6.  From the Compartment dropdown, select **&lt;USER&gt;-COMPARTMENT**.

7.  Select **Development or testing**. Your **OCPU count** updates to the preset governed by your selection.

8.  Select **Auto scaling**.

9.  For Subnet, select a subnet. If you're using the workshop environment, select **&lt;USER&gt;-SUBNET-PUBLIC**.

10.  For License type, select **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.

11. Click **Show advanced options**, and then select **Enable GoldenGate console public access**. 

12. Click **Next**.

    ![Completed Create GoldenGate Deployment fields](./images/create_deployment_1.png "" ) 

13. On the GoldenGate details screen, for Choose a deployment type, select **Stream analytics**.

14. For GoldenGate Instance Name, enter **ggsa**.

15. For Administrator Username, enter **osaadmin**.

16. For Administrator Password, click **Copy value** for **Admin Password** in Terraform Values section of your Reservation Information panel.

    ![Terraform values](./images/02-16-terraformvalues.png " ")

17. Click **Create**.

    ![Completed GoldenGate details](./images/create_deployment_2.png " ")

You're brought to the Deployment details page. Continue with the following tasks while the deployment creates. Its status changes from CREATING to ACTIVE when it's ready for you to use.

## Task 3: Create the GoldenGate connection

Follow these steps to connect the GoldenGate Replication deployment to the GGSA deployment.

1.  Use the Oracle Cloud Console breadcrumb to navigate to the **Deployments** page. 

    ![Deployments highlighted in Oracle Cloud Console breadcrumb](./images/03-01-deployments-breadcrumb.png " ")

2.  In the GoldenGate menu, click **Connections**.

    ![Connections in GoldenGate menu](./images/03-02-connections.png " ")

3.  On the Connections page, a precreated **ADB_Connection** connection appears in the Connections list for this lab. Click **Create connection**. 

    ![Connections page](./images/create_connection.png " ")

4.  The Create connection wizard consists of 2 pages. On the General information page, for Name, enter **GoldenGate** and optionally, a description.

5.  From the Compartment dropdown, select **&lt;USER&gt;-COMPARTMENT**.

6.  From the a Type dropdown, select **GoldenGate** from the **Generic** section.

7.  Click **Next**.

    ![GoldenGate details](./images/gg_connect_1.png)

8.  Open the Reservation Information panel, and then click **Copy value** for **GG Deployment Host**. 

    ![GG Deployment Host from Reservation Information](./images/03-08-gg-dep-host.png " ")

9.  On the Connection details page, under GoldenGate deployment, select **Enter GoldenGate information**

10.  For Host, paste the **GG Deployment Host** value copied from the Reservation Information panel (Step 8).

11.  For Port, enter **443**.

12.  For Username, enter **oggadmin**.

13. For Password, enter **Admin password** from the Reservation Information panel.

14. Click **Create**.
