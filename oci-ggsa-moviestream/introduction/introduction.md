# Introduction

The labs in this workshop will walk you through all the steps to get started using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate Stream Analytics (GGSA). You will provision a GGSA Deployment as well as multipe connections to Oracle Autonomous Database and Kafka instances. You will create a streaming pipeline consuming GoldenGate change records captured from an autonomous database, enrich the records with additional data, filter them based on geographical information and predictive scoring in Oracle Machine Learning (OML). Finally the events will be stored in the Autonomous Database and sent to Kafka topics for further processing. 

Watch the video below for an overview of OCI GoldenGate Stream Analytics.
