# Set up your environment

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to create the required resources you'll use for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate. You create a VCN and subnet, provision autonomous database instances, and load data into the databases.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

-  Provision a VCN and subnet
-  Provision, connect, and load data into an Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) instance
-  Provision, connect, and load data into an Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) instance

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you completed the Get started lab.

> **Note:** 
* You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.
* This workshop was designed to use Oracle Autonomous Databases as the source and target. If you plan to use Oracle Database, ensure that you use the CDB user to capture data from the PDBs.

## Task 1: Create a VCN and subnet

1.  Open the **Navigation Menu**, navigate to **Networking**, and select **Virtual Cloud Networks**.

	![Virtual Cloud Networks in Oracle Cloud navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/networking-vcn.png " ")

2.  On the **Virtual Cloud Networks in &lt;compartment-name&gt;** page, click **Start VCN Wizard**.

11. Click **Run Script**. The Script Output tab displays confirmation messages.

	>**Note:** If you find that running the entire script does not create the tables, then try running each table creation and insert statements one at a time until all the tables are created. You may also need to relaunch SQL to continue running the scripts until all tables are created and populated.

12. Close the SQL window and then reopen it from Database Actions.

13. In the Navigator tab, look for the SRC\_OCIGGLL schema and then select tables from their respective dropdowns to verify the schema and tables were created. You may need to log out and log back in if you can't locate SRC\_OCIGGLL.
