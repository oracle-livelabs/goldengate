# Create a trusted connection between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to download the root certificate from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and add it to the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager.  Adding the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure root certificate to Oracle GoldenGate creates a trusted TLS connection between OCI GoldenGate and Oracle GoldenGate.
