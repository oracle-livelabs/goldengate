# Create a trusted connection between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to download the root certificate from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and add it to the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager.  Adding the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure root certificate to Oracle GoldenGate creates a trusted TLS connection between OCI GoldenGate and Oracle GoldenGate.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Download the root certificate for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure from your web browser to your local machine
* Add the certificate to your Oracle GoldenGate wallet
* Create a credential on Oracle GoldenGate to connect to OCI GoldenGate

### Prerequisites

To successfully complete this lab, you must have:

* An on-premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance running
* The URL and log in credentials for the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager
* The log in credentials for the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console

## Task 1A: Using Chrome to download the root certificate

The following instructions show you how to download the Root Certificate using a Chrome web browser in Windows.

> **Note:** *Mac users should follow Task 1B and use FireFox to download the root certificate.*

1.  Launch the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console if you don't already have it open, and log in.

2.  In your Chrome browser address bar, click **View site information** (padlock icon), and then click **Connection is secure**.

    ![Select Connection is secure from View site information menu in Chrome browser](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-04-certificate.png " ")

3.  Click **Certificate is valid**.

    ![Select Certificate is valid from Connection is secure submenu in Chrome browser](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-03-certificate.png " ")

4.  In the Certificate Viewer, click **Details**.

    ![Select DigiCert Global Root G2, then click View Certificate in Certification Path tab of Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-04-certificate-window.png " ")

5.   Select **DigiCert Global Root G2** in the Certificate Hierarchy, and then click **Export selected certificate...**.

    ![Review Certificate Information in Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-04-digicert.png " ")

6.  In the Save As dialog, select a location on your local machine to save the root certificate, enter a file name such as **DigiCert-Root.pem**, and ensure the Save as type is Base64-encoded ASCII, single certificate (\*.pem; \*.crt), and then click **Save**.


## Task 1B: Using FireFox to download the root certificate

The following instructions show you how to download the Root Certificate using a FireFox web browser.

1.  Launch the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console if you don't already have it open, and log in.

2.  In your FireFox browser address bar, click **Verified by: DigiCert** (padlock icon), and then next to Connection Secure, click **Show connection details** (right arrow icon).

    ![Click Show connection details in Site information menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-02.png " ")

3.  In the **Connection Security** dialog, click **More information**.

    ![Click More information in Connection Security menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-03.png " ")

4.  In the **Page info** window, click **View Certificate**.

    ![Click View Certificate in Page Info dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-04.png " ")

5.  On the **Certificate** page, click **DigiCert Global Root G2**.

6.  Under the **Miscellaneous** section, for Download, click **PEM (cert)**, and save the PEM file to your local drive.

    ![Click PEM (cert) next to Download under the Miscellaneous section of the DigiCert Global Root G2 page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-06.png " ")

## Task 2: Upload the certificate to the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace Service Manager

Here, you'll upload the certificate to the Marketplace or on-premises Oracle GoldenGate instance to create a trusted connection to OCI GoldenGate.

1.  In the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace Service Manager, open the navigation menu, and then click **Certificate Management**.

    ![Select Certificate Management from Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-01-certmgmt.png " ")

2.  On the Certificate Management page, click **Add CA Certificates** (plus icon).

    ![Click Add CA Certificates on Certificate Management page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-03-addcert.png)

3.  In the Add CA Certificate dialog, enter a **Unique Name**.

    ![Enter a unique name in the Add CA Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-04-addcertdialog.png " ")

4.  For **Certificate PEM**, if you downloaded the root certificate from Chrome, open it in a text editor, and then copy and paste the key into the **Enter** text area.

    ![Example of entering a certificate into the Add CA Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-05-entercert.png " ")

5.  If you downloaded the root certificate from FireFox, click **Upload**, and then click **Browse**. Locate and select the PEM file on your local machine, and then click **Upload**.

    ![Example of uploading a certificate into the Add CA Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-06-uploadcert.png " ")

6.  Click **Add**.  The certificate now appears in the Shared list.

## Task 3: Add a credential for Oracle GoldenGate to connect to OCI GoldenGate

1.  In the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console, open the navigation menu and then click **Administrator**.

    ![Click Administrator in the OCI Goldengate deployment console navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-01.png " ")

2.  Click **Add User** and create a user account that Oracle GoldenGate will use to connect to OCI GoldenGate. For example, name the user **ggsnet** and assign the user the Operator role.

    ![Click Add User](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-02.png " ")

3.  Switch to the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace Administration Server, and use the Navigation menu to open the **Configuration** screen.

4.  Under the Database tab, click **Add Credential**, and then complete the following fields:

    * For **Credential Domain**, enter a name to distinguish this connection, such as **GGSNetwork**.
    * For **Credential Alias**,  enter a name, such as **ogg2ggs**.
    * For **User ID**, enter the user name of the user you created in step 2 (ggsnet).
    * For **Password**, enter the password associated to the user entered for User ID.
    * For **Verify Password**, re-enter the password for verification purposes.

    ![Add a Credential for ggsnet](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-04.png " ")

5.  Click **Submit**. You should now have two credentials in the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance, one to connect to OCI GoldenGate, and one for the source database.

    ![The Credentials page displays the new credential](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-05.png " ")

In this lab, you created a trusted connection between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate using a self-signed certificate. **Proceed to the next lab**.
