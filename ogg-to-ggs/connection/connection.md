# Create a trusted connection between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to download the root certificate from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and add it to the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager. Adding the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure root certificate to Oracle GoldenGate creates a trusted TLS connection between OCI GoldenGate and Oracle GoldenGate.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Download the root certificate for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure from your web browser to your local machine
* Add the certificate to Oracle GoldenGate's Administration Server
* Create a credential on Oracle GoldenGate to connect to OCI GoldenGate

### Prerequisites

To successfully complete this lab, you must have:

* An on-premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance running
* The URL and log in credentials for the Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager
* The log in credentials for the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console

## Task 1A: Using Chrome to download the root certificate

The following instructions show you how to download the Root Certificate using a Chrome web browser in Windows.

> **Note:** *Mac users should follow Task 1B and use **FireFox** to download the root certificate.*

1.  Launch the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console if you don't already have it open, and log in.

2.  In your Chrome browser address bar, click **View site information** (padlock icon), and then click **Connection is secure**.

    ![Select Connection is secure from View site information menu in Chrome browser](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-04-certificate.png " ")

3.  Click **Certificate is valid**.

    ![Select Certificate is valid from Connection is secure submenu in Chrome browser](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01-03-certificate.png " ")

4.  In the Certificate window, click **Certification Path**, select **DigiCert Global Root G2**, and then click **View Certificate**.

## Task 1B: Using FireFox to download the root certificate

The following instructions show you how to download the Root Certificate using a FireFox web browser.

1.  Launch the OCI GoldenGate Deployment Console if you don't already have it open, and log in.

2.  In your FireFox browser address bar, click **Verified by: DigiCert** (padlock icon), and then next to Connection Secure, click **Show connection details** (right arrow icon).

    ![Click Show connection details in Site information menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-02.png " ")

3.  In the **Connection Security** dialog, click **More information**.

    ![Click More information in Connection Security menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-03.png " ")

4.  In the **Page info** window, click **View Certificate**.

    ![Click View Certificate in Page Info dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-04.png " ")

5.  On the **Certificate** page, click **DigiCert Global Root G2**.

6.  Under the **Miscellaneous** section, for Download, click **PEM (cert)**, and save the PEM file to your local drive.

    ![Click PEM (cert) next to Download under the Miscellaneous section of the DigiCert Global Root G2 page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/01b-06.png " ")

## Task 2: Upload the certificate to the Oracle GoldenGate Marketplace Service Manager

1.  Open the on premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager in a browser window.

> **Note:** *To open the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager, use the Public IP of the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate compute instance from the Oracle Cloud Console, and then enter `<public-ip>:<port 443>` in your browser address bar.*

2.  From the navigation menu, click **Certificate Management**.

    ![Select Certificate Management from Oracle GoldenGate Service Manager navigation menu](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-01-certmgmt.png " ")

3.  On the Certificate Management page, click **Add CA Certificates** (plus icon).

    ![Click Add CA Certificates on Certificate Management page](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-03-addcert.png " ")

4.  In the Add CA Certificate dialog, enter a **Unique Name**.

    ![Enter a unique name in the Add CA Certificate dialog window](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/02-04-addcertdialog.png " ")

5.  For **Certificate PEM**, if you downloaded the root certificate from Chrome, open it in a text editor, and then copy and paste the key into the **Enter** text area.

3.  On the on-premises or Marketplace Service Manager Overview page, locate the Administration Server, and then click the link in the Port column. The on premises or Marketplace Administration Server opens in a new browser.

4.  Sign in to the on-premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate Administration Server with the same credentials used to log in to the Service Manager, and then use the Navigation menu to open the **Configuration** screen.

5.  Under the Database tab, click **Add Credential**, and then complete the following fields:

    * For **Credential Domain**, enter a name to distinguish this connection, such as **GGSNetwork**.
    * For **Credential Alias**,  enter a name, such as **ogg2ggs**.
    * For **User ID**, enter the user name of the user you created in step 2 (ggsnet).
    * For **Password**, enter the password associated to the user entered for User ID.

    ![Add a Credential for ggsnet](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-04.png " ")

6.  Click **Submit**. You should now have two credentials in the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance, one to connect to OCI GoldenGate, and one for the source database.

    ![The Credentials page displays the new credential](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/goldengate/ggs-common/connection/images/03-05.png " ")

In this lab, you created a trusted connection between Oracle GoldenGate and OCI GoldenGate using a self-signed certificate. **Proceed to the next lab**.
