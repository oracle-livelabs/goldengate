# Use the Admin Client to view Extract statistics and log messages

## Introduction

This **optional** lab guides you on how to connect to the on-premises or Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate Admin Client and then use it to view all running processes, Extract statistics, log messages, and purge unused files.

Estimated time: 5 minutes

### About the Admin Client
The Admin Client is a command line utility that uses Microservices REST API to control and configure tasks in an Oracle GoldenGate deployment. You can also use the Admin Client to create, change, and remove processes.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Connect to the Admin Client using Cloud Shell or an SSH client of your choice
* Run various commands

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you successfully completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Retrieve the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate Deployment URL

1.  Log in to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

2.  From the navigation menu, under **Oracle Database**, select **GoldenGate**.

## Task 2: Connect to the Admin Client

1.  Use Cloud Shell to SSH into the Marketplace Oracle GoldenGate instance.

    ```
    <copy>ssh -i <private-SSH-key> opc@<ip-address></copy>
    ```

    ![SSH command in Cloud Shell](images/02-01.png " ")

2.  Change directories to **/u01/app/ogg/bin**, and then start the Admin Client:

    ```
    <copy>adminclient</copy>
    ```

    ![Enter command to run Admin Client](images/02-02.png " ")

3.  Connect to the OCI GoldenGate deployment using the user name and password you entered in Lab: Create OCI GoldenGate resources, Task 1, steps 12 and 13.

    ```
      <copy>connect <OCI-GoldenGate-deployment-url> as <OCI-GoldenGate-user> password <OCI-GoldenGate-password> !</copy>
    ```
    > **Note:** *The exclamation point (!) is required. Without it, the command fails and returns an error.*

    ![Enter connect command into Cloud Shell as described in Step 3.](images/02-03.png " ")

4.  After connecting successfully, you can run any of the following commands:

    Display the status of OCI GoldenGate processes:
    ```
      <copy>info all</copy>
    ```

    ![info all command displays status for OCI GoldenGate processes](images/02-04a.png " ")

    View statistics of your Replicat:
    ```
    <copy>stats <replicat-name></copy>
    ```

    ![stats command displays statistics of process](images/02-04b.png " ")

    View the content of a ggserror log file:
    ```
    <copy>view messages</copy>
    ```

    ![view message command displays ggserror log file](images/02-04c.png " ")

    If your deployment had running Extract processes, then you can also purge old unused trail files using:
    ```
    <copy>purge exttrail <trail-file-name></copy>
    ```
