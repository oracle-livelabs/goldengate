# Review Configuration

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to monitor the Extract and Replicat processes that were created and run in the previous labs.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### About Performance Monitoring

Monitoring the performance of your GoldenGate instance ensures that your data replication processes are running smoothly and efficiently. You can monitor performance in the Oracle GoldenGate 23ai Microservices WebUI.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Review the Oracle GoldenGate Microservices, such as, Administration Service, Distribution Service, Performance Metrics Service, and Receiver Service.
* View charts and statistics using the Performance Metrics Server in the Oracle GoldenGate 23ai Microservices WebUI.
