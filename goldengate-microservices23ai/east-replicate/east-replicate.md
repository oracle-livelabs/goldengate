# Replicate data from East to West

## Introduction

In this lab, you create and run an Extract, add a User Administrator, create a Path Connection, create and run a Distribution Path, and create and run a Replicat that replicates data one way from East to West

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### About Extracts, Distribution Paths, and Replicats

An Extract is a process that extracts or captures data from a source database. A Distribution Path is a source-to-destination configuration that uses the Distribution Service to send data in a distributed environment. A Replicat is a process that delivers data to a target database.

### About User Administrators

Authorization in Oracle GoldenGate relies on user roles. As a User Administrator, you can choose and assign various user roles when creating Oracle GoldenGate users. These roles include a User, an Operator, an Administrator, and a Security.

### About a Path Connection

A Path Connection creates Credentials for the DistPath to connect to a GoldenGate Deployment. You will need to provide the login information for the GoldenGate alias. 

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Add and run an Extract process to capture data
* Create a new User Administrator
* Create a Path Connections
* Add and run a Distribution Path to send data
* Add and run a Replicat process to consume the trail file received from the West database
