### About Performance Monitoring

Monitoring the performance of your GoldenGate instance ensures that your data replication processes are running smoothly and efficiently. You can monitor performance in both the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate Deployment Console as well as in the Oracle Cloud Console on the Deployment Details page.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* View charts and statistics using the Performance Metrics Server in the GoldenGate deployment console
* Use Metrics on the Deployment Details page in the Oracle Cloud Console to determine overall instance health and utilization.

### Prerequisites

In order to complete this lab:
* You should have completed the preceding lab
