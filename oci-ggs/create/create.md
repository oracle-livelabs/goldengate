### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployments and connections

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections store the source and target credential information for OCI GoldenGate. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create the source and target connections
* Review the deployment details
* Assign connections to the deployments 


## Task 1: Review the deployment

1. In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

2. You may need to select a compartment. Under List Scope, from the Compartment dropdown, expand the root compartment, and then select the compartment.

3. On the GoldenGate **Overview** page, click **Deployment** and then **OCI GoldenGate Deployment**.

You can perform the following actions on the deployment details page:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 2: Create the source connection

[](include:01-create-source-connection.md)

## Task 3: Unlock the GGADMIN user and enable supplemental logging for the source database

[](include:02-unlock-source-ggadmin.md)

## Task 4: Create the target connection and unlock the GGADMIN user

[](include:03-create-target-connection.md)

## Task 5: Assign connections to the deployment

[](include:05-assign-connection.md)

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
