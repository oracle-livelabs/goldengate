## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to create an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate deployment.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployments and connections

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections store the source and target credential information for OCI GoldenGate. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create the source and target connections
* Review the deployment details
* Assign connections to the deployments 

## Task 1: Review the deployment

1. In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

2. On the GoldenGate **Overview** page, click **Deployments**.

3. On the Deployments page, under **List scope**, select your compartment from the **Compartment** dropdown.

    > **NOTE**: If you're using the LiveLab Sandbox environment, you can find your compartment number in the Reservation Information panel (View Login Info) of the workshop instructions.

4. Select **OCI GoldenGate Deployment** in the Deployments list.

You can perform the following actions on the deployment details page:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 2: Create the source connection

[](include:01-create-source-connection.md)

## Task 3: Unlock the GGADMIN user and enable supplemental logging for the source database

[](include:02-unlock-source-ggadmin.md)

## Task 4: Create the target connection and unlock the GGADMIN user

[](include:03-create-target-connection.md)

13. Repeat Task 3, steps 1-6, to unlock the GGADMIN user for the TargetADW database.

## Task 5: Assign connections to the deployment

[](include:05-assign-connection.md)

You may now **proceed to the next lab.**
