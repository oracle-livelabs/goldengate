# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources that you'll need to complete this workshop.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Connections capture source and target credential information. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create connections for the source and target Autonomous Databases
* Review the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Review the deployment details

1. If you're not already on the OCI GoldenGate Deployments page, then open the Oracle Cloud navigation menu, click **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

2. On the GoldenGate Overview page, click **Deployments**.

3. You may need to select your compartment from the Compartment dropdown. 

3. On the Deployments page, select the OCI GoldenGate deployment to view its details.

After the deployment is created and active, you can perform the following actions on the deployment details page:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 2: Create the source connection

Follow the steps below to connect the source Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing \(ATP\) Database.

[](include:01-create-source-connection.md)

## Task 3: Unlock the GGADMIN user and enable supplemental logging for the source database

[](include:02-unlock-source-ggadmin.md)


## Task 4: Create the target connection and unlock the GGADMIN user

Now, follow the steps below to connect the target Autonomous Data Warehouse \(ADW\) instance.

[](include:03-create-target-connection.md)

11.  Enter the following into the Worksheet, and then click **Run Statement**.

    ```
    <copy>ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA;</copy>
    ```

12.  Replace the supplemental logging script with the following to check support mode, and then click **Run Statement**:

    ```
    <copy>
    select * from DBA_GOLDENGATE_SUPPORT_MODE where owner = 'SRCMIRROR_OCIGGLL';
    </copy>
    ```

    The Script Output panel displays six tables whose Support_Mode is **FULL**.
