# Create the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate Deployment

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources that you'll need to complete this workshop.

Estimated time: 15 minutes

### About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate resources

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

Database Registrations capture source and target credential information. A database registration also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create a OCI GoldenGate deployment
* Create database registrations for the source and target Autonomous Databases
* Review the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Review the deployment's details

> **Note:** Compartment names in the screenshots may differ from values that appear in your environment.

1. In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu**, navigate to **Oracle Database**, and then select **GoldenGate**.

3. On the Deployments page, under **List scope**, select your compartment from the **Compartment** dropdown.

    > **NOTE**: If you're using the LiveLab Sandbox environment, you can find your compartment number in the Reservation Information panel (View Login Info) of the workshop instructions.

4. Select **OCI GoldenGate Deployment** in the Deployments list.

You can perform the following actions on the deployment details page:

* Review the deployment's status
* Launch the GoldenGate service deployment console
* Edit the deployment's name or description
* Stop and start the deployment
* Move the deployment to a different compartment
* Review the deployment resource information
* Add tags

## Task 2: Create the source connection

Follow the steps below to connect the source Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing \(ATP\) Database.

[](include:01-create-source-connection.md)

## Task 3: Unlock the GGADMIN user and check support mode for the source database

[](include:02-unlock-source-ggadmin.md)

## Task 4: Create the target connection

[](include:03-create-target-connection.md)

13.  Repeat Task 3 to unlock the GGADMIN user, enable supplemental logging, and check support mode on the TargetADW database.

## Task 5: Assign connections to the deployment

[](include:05-assign-connection.md)
