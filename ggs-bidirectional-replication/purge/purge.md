# Purge unused Trail files

## Introduction

This lab walks you through how to create Purge Tasks in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate Deployment Console.

Estimated time: 5 minutes

### About Purge Tasks

Purge Tasks help you to manage unused Trail files in your deployment. Trail files can add up over time and hinder the performance of your deployment.  

### Objectives

In this lab, you will create and run a Purge task.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you completed all preceding labs.
