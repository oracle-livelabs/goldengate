# Create the OCI GoldenGate resources

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to create Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate resources necessary to complete this workshop.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### About OCI GoldenGate deployments

A Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate deployment manages the resources it requires to function. The GoldenGate deployment also lets you access the GoldenGate deployment console, where you can access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console to create and manage processes such as Extracts and Replicats.

### About OCI GoldenGate connections

Connections capture source and target credential information. A connection also enables networking between the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) GoldenGate service tenancy virtual cloud network (VCN) and your tenancy VCN using a private endpoint.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Locate Oracle Cloud Infrastructure GoldenGate in the Console
* Create the deployments
* Review and access the OCI GoldenGate deployment details
* Create the connections
* Assign the connections to their respective deployments
* Access the OCI GoldenGate deployment console

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you completed all preceding labs.

## Task 1: Create the source deployment

1.  In the Oracle Cloud console, open the **navigation menu,** navigate to **Oracle Database**, and select **GoldenGate**.

3.  You may need to select a compartment. Under List Scope, from the Compartment dropdown, expand the root compartment, and then select the compartment **LiveLabCompartment**.

4.  In the Create Deployment panel, enter **SourceDeployment** for Name.

5.  From the Compartment dropdown, select **LiveLabCompartment**.

6.  Select **Development or testing**. The OCPU count autopopulates based on your selection.

7.  For Subnet, select a subnet. If you're using the workshop environment, select **LiveLabWebSubnet**.

8.  For License type, select **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.

9. Click **Show advanced options**, and then select **Enable GoldenGate console public access**.

10. Click **Next**.

11. For deployment type, select **Data replication**.

12. From a Select a technology dropdown, select **Oracle Database**.

13. For GoldenGate instance name, enter **ggsource**. Take note of the instance name. This helps you identify the source as you switch between deployment consoles. 

14. In an IAM-enabled tenancy, select a Credential Store.

    * If you select **OCI Identity and Access Management (OCI IAM)**, click **Create**, and then proceed to Task 2.
    * If you select **GoldenGate**, complete the following steps.

15. For Administrator username, enter **oggadmin**.

16. For Password secret in &lt;USER&gt;-COMPARTMENT, click **Create password secret**.

    ![Completed Create GoldenGate Deployment fields](./images/01-16-passwordsecret.png " ")

17. In the Create Secret panel, for Name, enter **LLsecret**.

18. From the Compartment dropdown, select **LiveLabCompartment**.

19. From the Vault dropdown, select your vault.

20. From the Encryption key dropdown, select your encryption key.

21. For User Password, enter a password 8 to 30 alphanumeric characters in length, containing at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 numeric, and 1 special character.

    > **Note:** The special characters must not be $, ^, or ?.

22. Click **Create**.

    ![Completed Create GoldenGate Deployment fields](./images/01-22-password-secret.png " ")

23. Back in the Create deployment panel, for Password secret, ensure **LLsecret** is selected, and then click **Create**.

You're brought to the Deployment Details page. It takes a few minutes for the deployment to be created. Its status changes from CREATING to ACTIVE when it's ready for you to use. You can continue with Tasks 3 and 4 while you wait for the deployment creation to complete.
